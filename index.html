    <h1>In Nashville's backyard, these towns are 
        luring travelers with their quiet charm</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      Even country music stars are catching on to the appeal of Leiper’s Fork and Franklin, 
      with their intimate venues, rolling hills, and front-porch communities.

      Twenty miles south of <u><strong>Nashville’s</strong></u> neon signs, two 
      <u><strong>Tennessee</strong></u> towns have been quietly attracting celebrities 
      and country music stars like Chris Stapleton and Carrie Underwood. Franklin charms 
      with its 19th-century downtown dotted with Southern boutiques, sophisticated dining, 
      and Civil War sites. Nine miles west, the village of Leiper’s Fork landed on the 
      National Register of Historic Places for its “folk vernacular” architecture, which 
      includes simple structures authentic to this rural region.

      This small community of 650 residents is renowned for its front porch guitar picking, 
      art galleries, and live music. The peaceful pace is a cool glass of sweet tea compared 
      to Nashville’s constant commotion. These two small towns offer visitors the chance to 
      rest, reflect, and reconnect with nature, while embracing creativity and comfort along 
      the Natchez Trace Parkway.

    <h2>A-list talent perform in small music venues</h2>

    <p>
      Franklin and Leiper’s Fork are teeming with places that attract up-and-coming music acts 
      and stars. <u>Kimbro’s Pickin’ Parlor</u>, Franklin’s juke joint for 20 years, buzzes with budding 
      musicians amongst poster-plastered walls. Jelly Roll, Jack White, and Greta Van Fleet have 
      jammed in the ragtag stage room, often described as banging and thriving. “Everyone’s [creative] 
      DNA is splattered all over the place,” says owner Will Jordan.

    <h2>Music City in the country</h2>

    <p>
      From intimate indoor attractions to boutique outdoor venues, the heart of this tight-knit 
      creative community draws extraordinary talent. A <u>limestone quarry</u> near Franklin’s horse farms 
      is now the world-class <u>FirstBank Amphitheater</u>. This 7,500-seat, 140-acre venue 
      feels like a nature preserve with ponds, trees, and wildlife. “It’s a one-of-a-kind experience 
      when the walls are lit up at night and the music sounds amazing because it refracts off the rocks,” 
      says Rick McEachern, who converted the space with his wife, Nancy. “You can see every star in the sky.” 
      Well-known singers, such as Chappell Roan, Willie Nelson, Miranda Lambert, and James Taylor, have performed 
      at the amphitheater. Chef-developed peach and prosciutto pizza and bourbon banana pudding are highlights on 
      the menu.
